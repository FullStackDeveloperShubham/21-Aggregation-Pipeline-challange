- **Day 16:** Recursive Trees — Use `$graphLookup`  
- **Day 17:** Dynamic Aggregation — Use `$let`, dynamic filters  
- **Day 18:** Analytics Dashboard — Combine stages for real-time analytics  
- **Day 19:** Performance Tuning — Use `explain()` and indexing  
- **Day 20:** Reusable Pipelines — Build reusable aggregation functions in JS
